                    <p class="sub-title"> <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right  text-primary"></i>
                        In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). We may, for example, sell products or provide services jointly with affiliated businesses, or work with third party websites to enhance your online experience. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to choose to automatically transmit information you input on the Website to your profile on a third party website; for example, you may update your contact information on the Website and allow that update to also be reflected in your Facebook account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow the automatic transmissions discussed above, please review all third party websites’ policies before engaging in such automatic transmissions on the Website. In addition, we will only contract with future companies that adhere to the same Pledge principles that members do.

                        We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. All third party partners must fully comply with our privacy policy and the Student Privacy Pledge and remain consistent with the same Pledge principles that Pledge members adhere to, including security and data retention principles. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For example, if you were to engage in a credit card transaction via the Website, we would need to allow a credit card processing company to verify the transaction; however, that company would only be authorized to use your credit card information to the extent we needed their assistance in completing your transaction.

                        We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we are reorganized or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. We will give you advance notice if your Personal Information will be transferred to a third party in this manner, so that you can delete your account with us if you choose.
